During my third week I learned how different academic reading was compared to recreational reading.

As I continued to sort through dense papers I began to formulate my own reading strategy to move through the papers quicker. Alongside Dr. Taylor, I was also assigned a graduate student to be my mentor, Tauhid. Tauhid gave me an important piece of advice: when entering a new field nothing will make sense no matter how knowledgable you are.

I realized that the more papers I read the better I would understand the foundational concepts that tied them together. I continued to learn about group activity recognition in this manner and became much more efficient.
