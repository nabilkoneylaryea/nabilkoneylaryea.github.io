This week was the first week I used Robot Operating System (ROS) and it was challenging to say the least ...

Before that though, I started the week by reading literature more in-depth and writing summaries for the most relevant papers. As I went through this process I started feeling much more efficient, but something was missing from my work.

I really wanted to start coding so I dove into learning how to use ROS. First, I had to update the lab computer to the most recent version of ROS (ROS2 Humble). After that, I read the documentation and watched videos on how ROS is structured. This was a great way to figure out how different components come together to create a certain robot functionality.

The last thing I worked on for this week were some ROS tutorials to understand how to use the ROS CLI and verify my ROS installation. The most interesting tutorial dealt with a program called gazebo. I launched gazebo from the ROS CLI and was able to control a turtlebot in a physics simulator!
