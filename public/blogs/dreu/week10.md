This week was mainly about wrapping up my project.

The highlight of this week was definitely getting access to the fabled Cornell computing resources. I spoke with my DREU advisor and was invited to continue working on this project with her virtually so that I could make further progress. I was really happy to accept her offer, because at this point I feel only the fun parts of my project are left.

I spent the majority of the week documenting the work i had done, and wrapping things up so I could come back to them at a later date!

Check out my final report to see the formalized overview of my work :)
