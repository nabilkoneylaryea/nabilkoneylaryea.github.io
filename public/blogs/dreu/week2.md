This week was when things really started to feel serious.

I started doing literature reviews from the first day this week. I can definitely say I felt like I knew nothing! Luckily Dr. Taylor guided me towards good conferences to look at and keywords to search up. Even though I was in the weeds I slowly began understanding things.

Towards the end of the week I was fortunate enough to attend a confrence on accessibility in Mixed Reality. Over the course of two days I was able to listen to several knowledgable speakers talk about different movements to include people of varying ability in the Mixed Reality Experience. These were genuinely topics I hadn't thought of before so deeply and I'm grateful that I could be exposed to so many important ideas.
