What can I say! My first week was crazy. I landed in New York the day before my internship started so I really didn't know what to expect.

Once I figured out where I was going, I arrived on campus and felt like I just dove in. I spent my first couple of days doing IRB trainings and then after that I started reading up on machine learning to prepare for my project.
